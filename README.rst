Overview
========

This project functions as a notetaking sandbox for studying the C 
programming language.
Specifically, the project is a summarization of the content of 
*21st Century C* by Ben Klemens.

To date, I am with great enthusiasm anticipating having found the
best resource for learning modern C.
